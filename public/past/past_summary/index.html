<div id="my-story-still-being-written" class="section level1">
<h1>My story, still being written</h1>
<p>The one-word characterization of this phase of my life is “engineering”. To be more specific I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering. Just as you didn’t go straight form birth into university - I didn’t either.</p>
<p>I was born in, and grew up in what I still to this day believe is the most beuatiful place in the world: Cape Town, South Africa. This little slice of heaven located almost at the bottom of the world has a lot to offer to anyone who visits. With a tragic history of racism and segregation (the social and economic impacts of which the country is actually still only in the beginning of starting to fix), and a lack of safety found in most of the more developed world, you might consider steering clear, but this would be a mistake. South Africa is a country with many issues, and lots of division that is true, but at its heart is a country full of people striving for a better future and always ready to welcome new people.</p>
<p>[insert photo of cpt here]</p>
<p>This photo shows the heart of the city, with the beautiful Table Mountain in the backdrop, but it doesn’t begin to reveal the extent of nature (beaches, mountains, forests, wine farms, animals, etc.), nightlife, food &amp; wine, and most importantly people that the country has to offer. I hope that if you have not visited Cape Town yet, that you have a chance to one day, and that you don’t hesitate to ask for travel tips, or report back to me on what your favorite part of your travels were!</p>
<p>I was a child who loved nature and friends, but was also plugged into the internet already probably around the age of 7. My childhood was filled with a complete mix of the digital and the natural. This gives you an idea of where the engineering story already started to be predetermined. Over the years I went through a Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, PS2, Nintendo DS, PSP, and finally made the leap with my first computer. After that I couldn’t get enough of building my own computers, the same for my friends, family, and anyone I could. I always loved understanding things at their most intricate level, and putting them back together.</p>
<p>I guess I wasn’t satisfied enough with the understanding of a computer I had from just reading things on the internet, by the time I finished school I decided to enroll in Stellenbosch Univerity’s E&amp;E Engineering Bachlor’s Program. Stellenbosch Universty is a place I feel tremendously fortunate to have been able to live and study for those four years.</p>

<p>My life was probably much like yours or many other’s during all those years (school and university). I did find myself discovering and loving a lot of interesting things, which I would love to share with you here.</p>
<p>Diving was something I got into when my desire to jump in the water was combined with an uncle who had a bunch of old kit he was willing to give me. It started with going under water to look at pretty sea life, progressed into diving with sharks, swimming through massive WW2 shipwrecks in the Red Sea, and eventually cave diving in abandoned mines with nothing but gas, light, and plenty of line to navigate! Thank God for that same uncle’s inability to not push things to the extreme that meant that we could experience some of the most incredible methods of diving underwater and could do it with family.</p>
<p>My love for nature also continued throughout my life, and Cape Town is not lacking in beautiful hiking trails.</p>
<p>I fell in love with traveling when, thanks to my great aunt, I went on my first real adventure of a trip through the South-East Asian countries of Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. If this was a travel diary I could write page after page about the magic of that trip, but what I can say is that trip opened up a hunger to travel that I think will never be satisfied (and I’m glad for that!).</p>
<p>I also learned a lot about what it means to be human and the implications of our existence on how exactly we should be living our life and spending time on this earth. I don’t want to say anything here about my beliefs and philosophical journey as that is something that always deserves its own conversation (that I’m always excited to have). I will say that my journey started with the works of American scientists as I contemplated athiesism, went deeply into the works of a few philosophers (some Greek but mostly French), moved into in what is still a journey today that is fueled by learning through life experiences rather than academic works (Michael Singer, Russel Brand, etc.), and has slowly transformed into a less self-centric exploration of the self into one concerning the wider world around me as I start to understand my priviledge and the existential obligation we all should have to making the world a better place. All of this combined with hundreds of hours of my own thought have led me to more certainty about my place in the world than ever before, but still totally aware of the spots of uncertainty. As I said, always a conversation I would love to have.</p>
<p>I learned that I have a great passion for classical music which I discovered through my grandfather but it was through going to live opera performances that I really feel in love. I was fortunate enough to start my opera journey in Cape Town where the performances are not of that same “perfection” as you find in Europe, and what a treat it was to start like that. Again, I can talk about this in person more but the first performance was with a cast of opera students that absolutely blew me away. Opera is best enjoyed with others, and it became a tradition to go with my mother every time a new opera started. What great memories.</p>
<p>I was never a sporty person growing up for anyone who would like to know. I started playing basketball because I was tall and my school made me play a sport (there is actually a funny story behind that), and I played squash because it was easily accessible to play with my dad. I definitely wish that was different because only once I got older did I realise how much I’d end up enjoying sports.</p>
<p>Then of course there is my true great love - film. I’m starting to believe that everybody truly resonates with one big art form above all others during their lives. For my mother it was fine art, for my father it was Tai chi, for my grandfather it was classical music, for my grandmother it was sewing, I could go on. And it’s subjectiveness is beautiful, whether you are into 50 Cent, Gaga, or Mozart - none is more superior than the other. Now that doesn’t mean people don’t love other art forms, in fact they do, many and they love them strongly, but my true love is film. Film of all lengths, colours, nationalities, and eras I love a good film and the people that craft them. They are about emotion, soul, shared experiences, and much, much more.</p>
<p>Trying to not abrubtly bring us back to my career, remember that all these things took place around the rest of my life, my friends, and my school/university. I loved all my hobbies, and I also loved most of my studies. Whether those were small assignments learning how transistors behaved, hwo to balance control systems, how to manage projects, or how to innovate and practice entrepreneurship, I loved all of it. I think as mucha s it was work, it always looped back strongly into the Albert Camus I read, where he proposed trying everything to its fullest as a rebellion against the absurd. In many ways I went to stud engineering because I really wanted to understand how the world’s computers, networks, and software worked, but I was able to give it my all out of a desire to make the most of my life, and to rebel against the absurd (leave it to me to tie existential fight into my engineering studies). What I got out of it was a view and understanding of the world I wouldn’t trade for a thing, and a problem solving mindset that can be applied in countless places (but not all, for many things there are more human approaches necessary).</p>
<p>It was coming out of these very studies that I realised however that there was so much more that I could do, that I could apply myself in an organizastion and leverage all I’d learned to help others and to create value through bigger systems. I hesitate to give myself too much self-importance by saying this but I came out of my studies feeling like I was born to make a bigger change and I little did I know at the time, but the next stage of my journey was going ot be where I found out exactly what that meant.</p>
<p>Below is a collection of photos, lists, and reports of all of the things that I described above. My hope is that these things can bring to life everything I’ve said.</p>
