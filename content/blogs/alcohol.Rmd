# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)
```

What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 
Variable types are chr (character), int (integer), and dbl (double).

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
beer_df <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings) %>%

  mutate(colour = ifelse(country == "Germany" | country == "Spain", TRUE, FALSE))
#highlighting Germany because we are here now, Spain because I am half Spanish

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

  select(country, wine_servings) %>%

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}

  mutate(colour = ifelse(country == "Germany" | country == "Spain"| country == "Russian Federation" | country == "Mexico", TRUE, FALSE))
#highlighting Germany because we are here now, Spain because I am half Spanish, Russia because of the vodka-drinking reputation, and the same for Mexico and tequila

spain_df <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings) %>% 
  mutate(colour = ifelse(country == "Spain" | country == "Mexico", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  filter(country == "Spain" | country == "Mexico")

spirit_df_withSpain <- rbind(spirit_df, spain_df)

mean_spirit <- spirit_df %>% #mean intentionally calculated using wine_df, because using wine_df_withSpain would skew results
  summarise(mean_spirit = mean(spirit_servings)) %>%

my_colours <- c("#a9a9a9", "#16c7ba")

top25SpiritPlot <- ggplot(spirit_df_withSpain, aes(y = reorder(country, spirit_servings), x  = spirit_servings, fill = colour)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_wsj(base_size = 5) + #theme with reduced text size
  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colours) + #using the colours of my choice instead of default red/blue (helps make my highlighted countries stand out)
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 spirit consumers worldwide (and Spain)",
    subtitle = "Note: Spain is not #26, it has simply been added for interest!",

What can you infer from these plots?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

My conclusion is that it seems that reputations are earned for a reason. Germany ranks 4th in beer consumption, France comes 1st for wine consumption, and Russia is 3rd for spirit consumption. I wonder what spirit that could be...

Also, an observation that countries for the most part don't repeatedly appear in the top 25 for multiple lists. The values here are per capita, and for a country to appear twice means that they drink a lot. For example Germany with both 346 servings of beer (per person, per year) AND 175 servings of wine (per person, per year). Impressive, or worrying?

Surprises:
- Spain not in top 25 for wine
- Mexico not in top 25 for spirits, in fact its consumption is relatively low (rank #89 only)
