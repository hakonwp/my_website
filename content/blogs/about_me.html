<h1>My story, still being written1234</h1>
<p>You’ve probably already noticed that I’ve structured this website in three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>past</strong> - Engineering</li>
<li>The <strong>present</strong> - Business</li>
<li>The <strong>future</strong> - People</li>
</ul>
<p>This, I’ve realised, is the best way to tell my story. You will notice the words next to the phases of my life (“Engineering”, “Business”, and “People”) too, these are the single-word characterizations of my career in its respective phases. I use my career as the needle to thread this story (I am creating this website in business school after all), I will however use this site as an opportunity to also write abut my life, my interests, and my thoughts.</p>
<p>To give a little summary of each stage they go something like this:</p>
<div id="past" class="section level2">

<p>As one can see, I have a <em>relatively</em> broad span of knowledge and interests. This breadth is how I have enjoyed living my life so far and will continue to do so down life’s path. Having learned what I have and experienced everything I have, this breadth and desire for development makes all the sense in the world. My hope is to paint a clear picture of this history and to communicate just how much sense it makes.</p>
<p>But as much as I want to share everything about me, this is not the blog of a narcissist. In the face of all I have learned, and the privilege I have had to do so, I hope to stay humble and appreciative through it all. This humbleness comes from realizing my position of privileged (there are a handful of people without whom I would not be where I am today), and also from realizing just how much more there (always) is to learn. If there is one thing I feel more certain about each day I learn more, it is that Socrates was right when he supposedly said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that I know nothing (The Socratic Paradox)</p>
