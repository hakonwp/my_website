<div id="my-story-still-being-written" class="section level1">
<h1>My story, still being written</h1>
<p>You’ve probably already noticed that I’ve structured this website in three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>past</strong> - Engineering</li>
<li>The <strong>present</strong> - Business</li>
<li>The <strong>future</strong> - People</li>
</ul>
<p>This, I’ve realised, is the best way to tell my story. You will notice the words next to the phases of my life (“Engineering”, “Business”, and “People”) too, these are the single-word characterizations of my career in its respective phases. I use my career as the needle to thread this story (I am creating this website in business school after all), I will however use this site also as an opportunity to write abut my life, my interests, and my thoughts.</p>
<p>To give a little summary of each stage they go something like this:</p>
<div id="past" class="section level2">

<p>As one can see, I have a <em>relatively</em> broad span of knowledge and interests. This breath is how I have enjoyed living my life so far and plan to continue to do so as I continue to grow along my life’s path. Having learned what I have and experienced everything I have, this breadth and desire for development makes all the sense in the world. My hope is to paint a clear picture of this history and to communicate just how it makes so much sense.</p>
<p>But as much as I want to share everything about me, I want to avoid coming across as a narcissist. In the face of all I have learned, and the privilege I have had to do so, I hope to stay humble and appreciative through it all. This humbleness comes from realising my position of privileged, and also from realising just how much more there (always) is to learn. If there is one thing I feel more certain about each day I learn more, it is that Socrates was right when he (supposedly) famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that I know nothing (The Socratic Paradox)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
