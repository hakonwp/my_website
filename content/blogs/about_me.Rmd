# Jack of all trades, master of many
This is what my self-titled biography would be called.

My **background** is in

* Electronic & electrical engineering
* Finance
* Sales
* Operations

and my **passions** include

* Film
* Road cycling
* Underwater cave diving
* Mountain trail walking
* Travel
* Philosophy, history & psychology
* Opera & ballet
* Basketball
* Squash

As one can see, the span of my knowledge and interests is _relatively_ wide. While I cannot be a master of all, I am strong in matters of technology, finance, and film, and the rest I feel at least very comfortable with.

In fact, I even have a list of favourite films of all time which can be found [here](https://boxd.it/11A8s).

With all I have learned in my life, I feel that the Socratic paradox could not be more true:

> I know that I know nothing

Sincerely,
Hakon Wulf Petermann Rueda\
