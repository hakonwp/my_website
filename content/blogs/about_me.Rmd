# My story, still being written

You've probably already noticed that I've structured this website in three main parts:

* The **past** - Engineering
* The **present** - Business
* The **future** - People

This, I've realised, is the best way to tell my story. You will notice the words next to the phases of my life ("Engineering", "Business", and "People") too, these are the single-word characterizations of my career in its respective phases. I use my career as the needle to thread this story (I am creating this website in business school after all), I will however use this site also as an opportunity to write abut my life, my interests, and my thoughts.

To give a little summary of each stage they go something like this:

## Past

* Career
    * Engineering
  
* Studies
    * Electrical & Electronic Engineering
  
* Life
    * Film
    * Diving
    * Love of nature
    * Travel
    * Philosophy, history & psychology
    * Opera & ballet
    * Basketball
    * Squash

## Present

* Career
    * Business
  
* Studies
    * CFA
    * Sales role
    * Operations role(s)
    * Business school
    * PMP

* Life
    * Road cycling
    * Books I've read
    * Holidays to Europe and life in Europe
    * Podcasts
    * Relationship w/ Meg?
    * Geopolitics + macroeconomics

## Future

* Career
    * People (developing as a manager)
  
* Studies
    * Business school
  
* Life
    * Books
    * Experiences at school
    * Role models of leaders

As one can see, I have a _relatively_ broad span of knowledge and interests. This breath is how I have enjoyed living my life so far and plan to continue to do so as I continue to grow along life's path. Having learned what I have and experienced everything I have, this breadth and desire for development makes all the sense in the world. My hope is to paint a clear picture of this history and to communicate just how much sense it makes.

But as much as I want to share everything about me, this is not the blog of a narcissist. In the face of all I have learned, and the privilege I have had to do so, I hope to stay humble and appreciative through it all. This humbleness comes from realising my position of privileged (there are a handful of people without whom I would not be where I am today), and also from realising just how much more there (always) is to learn. If there is one thing I feel more certain about each day I learn more, it is that Socrates was right when he (supposedly) famously said:

> I know that I know nothing (The Socratic Paradox)
